# Learning to bake

I have become a reasonable cook in my time, but never took to baking. Jinnah will teach me some basics.

## Snickerdoodles

Starting with snickerdoodles.

### On Hand

This was the first recipe I found where I had all the ingredients on hand, except for cinnamon sticks:

They came out pretty well, but I overbaked them. The instructions said "firm around the edges but steamy in the middle," which I found difficult to judge.

I also baked two pans in the oven at once, and there was a distinct difference between the top and bottom tray.

### Test Kitcken

I love the America's Test Kitchen cookbooks, and one I had has a snickerdoodle recipe, that asked for cream of tartar, and vegetable shortening. Having acquired those, I commenced my second bake:

These came out nicer, primarily because I was much more diligent about checking for done-ness, and I did both pans separately.

These didn't have as much cinnamon flavour (the first recipe had me sprinkle leftover cinnamon dredging on the cookies, this one didn't), but were otherwise preferred.


### Jinnah's tweaks

 - Lemon juice instead of cream of tartar
 - 1/3 - 1/2 whole wheat flour
 - Brown sugar in the dough (not for rolling)
 - Chill the dough
 - Replace butter with cultured butter
 - Don't use salted or cultured butter for icing

 ## Next: Chocolate Chip cookie
 
 - White chocolate, macadamia nut?
 - 
 
 ## Shortbread cookie?
 
 (A lot more butter and flour)
 
 
 ## Later on: yeasted bread or cake
